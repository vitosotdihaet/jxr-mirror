'''
This script is used for debugging ML model
It creates a window with a stream from chosen camera
Later this script will show you not only the stream, but also an output of ML model

With this script you can change between different cameras with keys, listed in keycodes.py
For example you can use DroidCam to use your Android device as a camera
